# BadCrypto Benchmark

To run the benchmark, start ```RunBench.bat```, This will hash the data file, both before and after encryption, and display the execution time.

Run the bench a second time to decrypt the file, *BadCrypto* is xor encryption, so the same executable will both encrypt and decrypt the file (provided the password is the same).
